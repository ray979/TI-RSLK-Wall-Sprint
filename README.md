# TI-RSLK-Max-Wall-Sprint

Wall Sprint code for Spring 2022 EECS 195: Embedded Systems course final at University of California, Irvine. The objective of the wall sprint is to first cross starting line, then sprint through a narrow lane bounded by electrical tape without going out of bounds, hit a wall, turn around, sprint through the same lane again, and finally stop when crossing the starting line the second time.
